#CS1501 Write-Up
I found assignment 3 to be easier than the previous two assignments, but it did require a lot of thinking. There was little code to type, and this made the assignment easier than others, however; the little code you had to type required a lot of thinking.  I started by using lab 7 as a base because a lot of the code can be used for this assignment, especially the data structure used as a symbol table. I am grateful that the labs are build ups to the assignments because I would have been completely lost without them. I had to make some changes to the code in lab 7. The first thing I changed was W and L because they were fixed number, but we needed them to vary so that we can have variable length encoding. I changed W to 9 and then incremented only when the symbol table was full, and it could not exceed 16. I did this for both compress and expand. Afterwards, I started to work on the code to reset the codebook.  The challenging part about this was how to tell the expand method that the user wants to reset. I figured this out by using one of the methods in BinaryStdOut.java. If the user wants to reset, I construct a new codebook with the original 256 characters and reset W to 9 and then I add new codewords to the codebook. Once this was complete, I began to compress and expand files and it was interesting to see the results.
For all.tar I believe LZW with reset had the best compression while the original LZW had the worst compression. It is worth mentioning that Linux compress came very close to LZW with reset in terms of compression. I believe LZW with reset and Linux compress had better compression because when the codebook was reset, we were able to create new patterns and thus allow for better compression. Moreover, the maximum code word length is 16 for LZWmod which means that we can have more codewords. In the case of LZW I believe the file changed and so compression was not good and the maximum amount of codewords was 40916, which is not that much. For the files assig2.doc, bmps.tar, code.txt, code2.txt, and wacky.bmp the best compression was with LZW with no reset, LZW with reset and Linux compress. This means that the original LZW had the worst compression. I believe that reset and no reset provided the same compression because the file was not very different. This means that we were not able to build up many new patterns with reset which gave the same compression as no reset. It Is also possible that some of the files were not big enough to trigger a reset. The compression ratio of Linux compress for edit.exe was the best compared to the other algorithms. LZW with reset came close while the original LZW had the worst compression. In fact, the original LZW led to a bigger file size and I believe this is because of the fixed length encoding and potentially because the patterns created were not very long. It is possible that Linux compress performed best because of its variable length encoding. 
Linux compress also performed best with frosty.jpeg and texts.tar while original LZW performed worst, and I believe it is a similar explanation to edit.exe. None of the algorithms were able to effectively compress gone_fisihing.bmp.z  and I think itâ€™s because this file has already been compressed. If you compress an already compressed file you will not get good compression. For large.txt and Lego-big,gif, LZW with no reset had the best compression with a compression ratio of 2.4 while the worst compression is the original LZW.  The new patterns formed when resetting where not very long which is why LZW with reset did not perform as good as LZW with no reset. All of the algorithms had the same compression for medium.txt and I believe this is because of the file. The file was not that big so there was no reset needed which means they all had the same compression. LZW with no reset, LZW with reset and Linux compress all had the best and same compression for winnit256.BMP. The original LZW had the worst compression, and the explanation is like the ones previously mentioned.
Based on the data it looks like LZW with reset or Linux compress had the best compression, and this Is likely because new patterns that are longer can be formed and because of the variable length encoding. Finally, I would like to say that learning about compression has been both interesting and challenging. This assignment showed me the difference between compression algorithms and why one might perform better than the other.
